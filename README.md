# Financial Insight Project

Welcome to the Financial Insight Project repository! This initiative focuses on harnessing Python to create compelling visualizations of financial data, including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flows. Our dataset spans yearly financial figures from 2018 to 2022, providing a robust foundation for insightful analysis and visualization.

# Dataset
The dataset is stored in a CSV file named sample_accounting_transactions.csv, which includes three sheets: each dedicated to one of the mentioned financial statements.

# Project Overview
This project comprises several steps and components aimed at analyzing and visualizing the entity's performance during 2018-2022"
- Importing necessary libraries and gaining an initial understanding of the data structure and values.
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaning the data by removing duplicates and handling any missing values.
- Comparative Analysis and Visualization:
    + Comparing the trend of Revenue and Earnings After Tax.
    + Visualizing Asset Ratios.
    + Analyzing the tendency of Cash Flows.

# Results
During the Covid-19 period:
- Revenue Partially Recovered: Although revenue saw some recovery, earnings after tax remained negative throughout 2020 to 2022.
- Short-term Assets Ratio Declined: The ratio of short-term assets decreased within the asset structure during the Covid-19 period, indicating that the company might have had to rely heavily on its short-term assets to sustain operations.
- Negative Operating Cash Flow: Cash flows from operating activities were consistently negative.
